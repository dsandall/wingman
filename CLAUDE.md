## Overview

Cross-platform Python CLI tool for running multiple NetBird instances alongside the primary
installation. Each named instance gets an isolated config dir, daemon socket, and WireGuard
interface name.

## Project Structure

- `src/wingman/cli.py` — Typer app, subcommands (`up`, `down`, `status`, `list`)
- `src/wingman/instance.py` — Instance lifecycle orchestration
- `src/wingman/config.py` — Config dir resolution, instance metadata, PID files
- `src/wingman/daemon.py` — Daemon process management
- `src/wingman/netbird.py` — Shelling out to netbird binary
- `src/wingman/platform.py` — OS-specific logic (paths, sockets, interface names)
- `tests/` — Unit tests (mocked, no real netbird needed)

## Architecture Notes

- All platform branching is in `platform.py` — other modules are OS-agnostic
- `platform.py` now also resolves NetBird runtime details per instance (`config` path + runtime env), including Linux non-root `NB_STATE_DIR` handling
- `netbird.py` shells out to NetBird and supports runtime env injection for daemon startup; `run_up` also forwards `NB_STATE_DIR` and selects the instance's `--profile` (NetBird 0.72+) so the client doesn't fall back to the user's default profile
- `instance.py` orchestrates but delegates to `config`, `daemon`, `netbird`, and `service` modules
- Linux user systemd units include required runtime environment variables (for example `NB_STATE_DIR`) when persistence is registered; after registering a `--user` unit, `service.py` points the user at `loginctl enable-linger` if linger is off (a `--user` unit only starts on boot once linger is enabled)
- On Linux the daemon lifecycle is **owned by systemd**: `up` registers + `systemctl [--user] start`s the unit (waiting for the socket) and `down` stops it, so the running daemon is the unit (`systemctl status` shows `active`, no orphaned process). `service.py` exposes `start_service`/`stop_service`/`is_service_active`/`service_main_pid`; `status`/`list` query systemd first. Where no service manager exists (containers, macOS, Windows) wingman falls back to a directly-supervised daemon tracked via PID files with stale-PID detection
- The recommended Linux setup is **rootless**: the daemon runs as the user (config under `~/.config/wingman`, no `sudo` for everyday commands), with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` granted to the `netbird` binary so it can create the WireGuard interface. `instance.py` preflights this (`_require_kernel_iface_capability`) and aborts a rootless `up` with the exact `setcap` command when the capability is missing. See `packaging/` for the pacman hook that keeps the capability applied across netbird upgrades
- **DNS** is entirely NetBird's job — wingman has no DNS code; it only keeps each instance's interface/state separate so NetBird's per-interface DNS doesn't collide. NetBird binds its resolver to each instance's interface IP and registers it per-link with systemd-resolved using `~`-prefixed match domains (split DNS), so instances coexist without a global resolver takeover. The one rootless gotcha: a non-root daemon's resolved calls (`org.freedesktop.resolve1.set-*`) are **denied by polkit** unless a rule grants them — symptom is `resolvectl status <iface>` showing `Current Scopes: none` and a `failed to apply DNS host manager update … requires interactive authentication` line in `daemon.log`. The fix mirrors setcap: a shipped polkit rule (`packaging/arch/wingman-netbird-dns.rules`, authorizing the `wheel` group) installed to `/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/`. `instance.py` preflights it (`_warn_resolved_dns_unauthorized`, probing via `pkcheck`) and **warns without blocking** on a rootless `up`, since DNS failure is non-fatal (the tunnel still works). Caveat: separate NetBird accounts share the `netbird.cloud` zone, so their match domains overlap — fine unless a peer hostname is duplicated across accounts
